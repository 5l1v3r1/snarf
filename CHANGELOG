BUGS
----
Fixed typo in smbbroker.js(line:227) - s/middler.attributes.timreID/middler.attributes.timerID
Fixed issue affecting deactivateKeepAlive().
    The function would not properly execute when called from server.on('error'). The
    variable passed from broker.deactivateMiddler() was type integer, representing the
    middler ID. However, the deactivateKeepAlive() function expected a middler object.
    The code was modified(middler.js-line:168) to pass the current middler object. This
    seemed to work well since it supported other areas that called the function with a
    middler object. Two additional lines (broker.js-line:120-121) were modified accordingly.
