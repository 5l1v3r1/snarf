TODO: BUGS
----------
Several issues originating from blocking component:
  - New snarf session -> Block session -> Remove session from blacklist -> Attempt to connect again
  - possibly caused by 'VC' flag; see smbbroker.js : lines 179-191
Assign STDOUT colors according to snarf component (error/web/broker/middler/etc.)
Windows version and build number are inaccurate for Windows XP systems -- possibly offset issue via null byte padding
Terminating sessions raises error events -- possibly due to keepalive
Blacklist 'pop' function does not properly remove all instances of IP address
